/* Tests argument passing stack overflow is handled for a single over-long argument. 
   The process arguments, and their pointers, will not fit onto the child process's stack, unless stack growth is implemented for argument passing.
   It is acceptable for the child process to report a load failure, to abort during argument passing, or to grow the stack to support the arguments.
   
   In the latter case, only the first 1013 characters of the first argument will be printed, due to size limitations on the output buffer used by the msg function.
   This behaviour is, however, entirely optional (even in Task 3).
